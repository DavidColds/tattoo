        <h5 class="font-weight-normal mb-3">What should you think about before getting tattooed?
        </h5>
        <p class="text-muted">Sleep and good food is important so you will feel energized and happy on the day
          of your tattoo session.
          Put on some comfortable clothes that you are not apprehensive about.
          I recommend to have some snack with you, ex. juice, fruit or candy so you quickly
          can refuel with energy if necessary.
          If you would feel nervous or start feeling sick, remember that its fully normal and
          OK to say something, we are all humans. And my wish it to give you a safe and
          positive experience.
          To be drunk, hungover and/or very tired might be and bad idea and could lead to
          a reschedule of your time. It will hurt more and bleed more, which will make it
          harder for the pigment to stay in the skin.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4 mb-4">
        <h5 class="font-weight-normal mb-3">Aftercare</h5>
        <p class="text-muted">Wash you tattoo morning and evening, or/and when needed.
          Lubricate careful with a thin layer of aftercare cream/gel 3 times/day, or when it
          feels dry.
          Don't take too much, generally it's better to lubricate a little bit less than more.
          After some days there will form a thin crust that will crack and flake.
          It will sometimes look weird but itʼs fully normal.
          Continue to lubricate until all crust has came off. It usually takes 7-14 days.
          Make sure NOT to scratch or peel on the crust! It can result in infections, color
          loss and/or ugly scars that could be very hard to correct.
          Avoid solariums, pools, saunas and close contact exercises.
          Avoid movements that would make you feel ”tension” in the tattoo.
          Be careful with clothes and jewelry that could chafe.
          You will have thin skin bove your tattoo when the crust has came off.
          It will be replaced with normal skin durin 3 to 4 weeks.
          During this time you need to be careful to expose it to the sun. Now you can start
          lubricate with normal lubricate if you want.
          Not until the skin is fully healed (around ( month) will you be able to see the
          actual result.</p>
